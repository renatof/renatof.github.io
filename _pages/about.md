My research career has focused on the use of resource virtualization techniques in computer systems design as a means of improving flexibility, manageability, and isolation of systems, while supporting a wealth of existing, unmodified applications. My current research emphasis is on software-defined overlay virtual private networks supporting IoT, edge and cloud computing distributed systems. Most recently, my research has found practical applications in inter-disciplinary collaborations on ecological forecasting, biodiversity, and smart and connected communities. In particular, my inter-disciplinary collaborations in ecological forecasting have led to multiple successful NSF awards, My current research focuses on the following topics:

* Virtualization in distributed systems (virtual machines, networks, file systems)
* Edge computing and virtual private networks
* Cloud computing systems and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) applications in ecological forecasting
* Overlay networks and their applications in systems design
