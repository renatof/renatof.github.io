Course Description
======
This class provides a broad introduction to the main principles and abstractions for engineering hardware and software systems, and in-depth studies of their use on computer systems across a variety of designs, be it in operating system, a client/server application, a database server, or a fault-tolerant disk cluster. This is a 3-credit course.

Course Pre-Requisites / Co-Requisites
======
Digital design (EEL4712 or equivalent); introduction to programming or data structures/algorithms (EEL4834 or equivalent), or instructor approval. Programming in a high-level language

Textbook
======
“Principles of Computer System Design”, Jerome E. Saltzer and M. Frans Kaashoek, Morgan Kaufmann, first edition, 2009, ISBN number: 9180123749574

Course Objectives
======
The design of hardware and software in computer systems ranging from personal devices to large-scale distributed, networked computers is an increasingly complex undertaking and requires understanding not only of individual sub-systems, such as the micro-processor, but also the interactions among sub-systems. This class provides a broad introduction to the main principles and abstractions for engineering computer systems, and in-depth studies of their use on computer systems across a variety of designs, be it an operating system, a client/server application, a database server, or a fault-tolerant disk cluster.
Design/programming assignments and a project will be assigned in this class. These entail an exploration of a topic related to the design of a computer system through implementation of a prototype. The assignments and project will require significant software programming using the Python high-level language.
