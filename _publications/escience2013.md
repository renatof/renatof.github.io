A core mission of the Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio) project is the building and deployment of a cloud computing environment customized to support the digitization workflow and integration of data from all U.S. non-federal biocollections. iDigBio chose to use cloud computing technologies to deliver a cyber infrastructure that is flexible, agile, resilient, and scalable to meet the needs of the biodiversity community. In this context, this paper describes the integration of open source cloud middleware, applications, and third party services using standard formats, protocols, and services. In addition, this paper demonstrates the value of the digitized information from collections in a broader scenario involving multiple disciplines.
