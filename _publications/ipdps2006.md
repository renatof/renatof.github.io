Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have mostly focused on task oriented networking, where networks are constructed for single applications, i.e. file-sharing, DNS caching, etc. In this work, we introduce IPOP, a system for creating virtual IP networks on top of a P2P overlay. IPOP enables seamless access to grid resources spanning multiple domains by aggregating them into a virtual IP network that is completely isolated from the physical network. The virtual IP network provided by IPOP supports deployment of existing IP-based protocols over a robust, self-configuring P2P overlay. We present implementation details as well as experimental measurement results taken from LAN, WAN, and Planet-Lab tests
