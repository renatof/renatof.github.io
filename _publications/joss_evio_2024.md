This paper describes the EdgeVPN.io software, a novel technique that enables
virtual private Ethernet networks that span edge and cloud resources – including those constrained by NATs and firewalls. EdgeVPN.io has been implemented as an open-source virtual network software solution, and experiments with the software have demonstrated its functionality and scalability.
